      <p> I have been a fan of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band since 1980. I have been to over 200 shows since 1999 all over the US and around the world. I have made hundreds of friends in my travels and I fell in love with my wife in 2008 while traveling to shows in Europe. We were in Hamburg, Milan, Paris and Copenhagen.</p>

      <p> Every show is different and everyone should have something in life they feel this passionate about.</p>
    <p> Some of my most special places to have seen shows are in Kansas City, Philadelphia, Foxboro and of course New Jersey. Some people dont like stadium shows but I love them.</p>  
    <p> When we are not traveling to shows, our dog Jersey keeps us busy. I also have a terrific niece named Rowan and a nephew named Anthony. I am so proud of these two kids and I love being able to make a difference in their lives.</p>

    <p>That's about all I have to say right now, back to GW Coding Bootcamp. </p>
    <p>No Retreat Baby, No Surrender </p>
